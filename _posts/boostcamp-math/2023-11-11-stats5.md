<h2>5강- 조건부 확률과 전확률정리 (Conditioning Continued, Law of Total Probability)</h2>

<h2>학습목표</h2>

전체 확률의 법칙을 이해하고 문제풀이에 적용할 수 있으며, 조건부 독립의 개념을 이해한다.

<h2>핵심 키워드</h2>

- 전체 확률의 법칙(Law of Total Probability)
- 조건부 확률
- 사전확률과 사후확률(prior, posterior probability)
- 조건부 독립(conditional independence)


- Intro<br><br>
: : <u>Thinking conditionally is a condition for thinking</u>
: : <u>**How to solve a problem**</u>
: <br><b>(1) Try simple and extreme cases</b><br><br>
: :  Feynman Algorithm - Write down the problem, think hard about it, write down the solution (...)
: <br><b>(2) Break up problem into simpler pieces</b><br><br>

: : Let A<sub>1</sub>, ... ,A<sub>n</sub> <u>partition</u>
: : Then P(B) = P(B ⋂ A1) + ... + P(B ⋂ A<sub>n</sub>)
:  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;= P(B ⎸ A<sub>1</sub>) · P(A<sub>1</sub>) + ... + P(B ⎸ A<sub>n</sub>) · P(A<sub>n</sub>) 
:  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
: : **Law of Total Probability(전체 확률의 법칙)**<br><br>
- Example (1)<br><br>
: : Get random 2-card hand from standard card deck<br><br>
: : 1) Find the P(both aces ⎸ have ace)
: &emsp;&emsp;= P(both aces, <s>have ace</s>) / P(have ace) = (<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> / <sub>52</sub>C<sub>2</sub>) / 1 - <sub>48</sub>C<sub>2</sub> / <sub>52</sub>C<sub>2</sub> = 1/33 (≈ 3%)<br><br>
: : 2) P(both aces ⎸ have Ace of Spades)
: &emsp;&emsp;[♠] [?] - By **symmetry**, this card is equally likely to be any of the 51 cards in the deck other than the ace of spades
: &emsp;&emsp; = 3 / 51 (by **symmetry**)
: &emsp;&emsp; = 1 / 17 (about twice as likely than 1))<br><br>
- Example (2)<br><br>
: : Patient gets tested for disease afflicts 1% of population, and the patient tests positive
: : Suppose test is advertised as "95% accurate"
: : **D** - patient has disease / **T** - patient tests positive
: : suppose this means...
: : P(T ⎸ D) = 0.95 = P(T<sup>C</sup> ⎸ D<sup>C</sup>)<br><br>
: : but our goal is to find, 
: : **P(D ⎸ T)** = P(T ⎸ D) · P(D) / P(T) (Bayes' rule) 
: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;= P(T ⎸ D) · P(D) / P(T ⎸ D) · P(D) + P(T ⎸ D<sup>C</sup>) · P(D<sup>C</sup>) 
: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(Expanded the denominator with law of total probability, partition being either the patient has the disease or does not have the disease)
: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;≈ 0.16
: : It's fairly rare that the test is wrong, but it's also fairly rare that the disease itself is rare. This is why people's intuition is wrong.<br><br>
- Common mistakes of conditional probability (Biohazards)<br><br>
: <br><b>(1) Confusing P(A ⎸ B), P(B ⎸ A)</b><br><br>
: : "Prosecutor's fallacy"
: : Ex) Sally Clarke case, SIDS(sudden infant death syndrome)
: : she was convicted of murder
: : Expert said 1 / 8500 chance that the baby just died mysteriously.
: : And there were two babies, so (1/8500)<sup>2</sup> = 1 / 73 ·  10<sup>6</sup>(?)
: : First mistake was to assume independence
: : But what we want is P(innocence ⎸ evidence) (not P(evidence  ⎸ innocence))
: : Prior probability, "innocence" is extremely close to 1
: <br><b>(2) Confusing P(A), "prior" with P(A ⎸ B), "posterior"</b><br><br>
: : Even if A has happened, P(A ⎸ A) = 1, not P(A) = 1
: <br><b>(3) Confusing independence with conditional independence</b><br><br>
: : **Def)** Events A, B are conditionally independent given C
: : if P(A ⋂ B ⎸ C) = P(A ⎸ C) · P(B ⎸ C)
: : Does conditional independence, given C imply unconditional independence? => No, not in general.
: : **Ex)** Chess opponent of unknown strength
: : It may happen that game outcomes are conditionally independent, but not independent
: : Conditionally independent given strength of your opponent, but not independent unconditionally<br><br>
: : Does independence imply conditional independence given C?
: : **No.** The reason is?
: : **Ex)** **A** - fire alarm goes off 
: : caused by : **F** - fire, **C** - popcorn
: : Suppose F, C are indep. <u>But</u> P(F ⎸ A, C<sup>C</sup>) = 1
: : not cond. independent, given A
