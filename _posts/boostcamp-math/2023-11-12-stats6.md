# 23/11/12 확률론 6강

<h2>6강- Monty Hall 문제와 심슨의 역설 (Monty Hall, Simpson's Paradox)</h2>

- 학습목표
: - Monty Hall 문제를 이해하고 확장해 볼 수 있으며, 심슨의 역설을 이해한다.

- 핵심 키워드
: - Monty Hall
: - 전체 확률의 법칙
: - 심슨의 역설(Simpson's Paradox)


- Monty Hall Problem<br><br>
<img src="../../images/231112 stats 6-1.png" width="500px"><br><br>
: : 1 door has car, 2 doors have goats
: : Monty always open a goat door <br>(<u>Monty knows which</u> - So if I choose the door with a goat behind it, he has only one choice of door to open)
: : He picks a goat door with equal probability
: : If Monty opens Door 2, we know Door 2 has a goat <u>and</u> Monty opened door 2.
: <br><b>1) Tree Diagram Solution</b><br><br>
: : Below is the "Tree diagram"<br>
<br><br><img src="../../images/231112 stats 6-2.png" width="500px">
: <br><b>2) Law of total probability solution (LOTP)</b><br><br>
: : We wish we knew where the car is
: **S** : Succeed (assuming switch)
: **D<sub>j</sub>** : Door j has car(j ∈ {1, 2, 3})
: **P(S)** = P(S ⎸ D<sub>1</sub>) · P(D<sub>1</sub>)<span style="color:gray">( = 1/3)</span> + P(S ⎸ D2)  · P(D<sub>2</sub>)<span style="color:gray">( = 1/3)</span> + P(S ⎸ D3) · P(D<sub>3</sub>)<span style="color:gray">( = 1/3)</span>
: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;= 0 + 1 · 1/3 + 1 · 1/3 = 2/3
: (We're assuming that car is behind door 1)
: : By symmetry, P(S ⎸ Monty opens door 2) = 2/3
: : There would be asymmetry if Monty prefers one door over another.
: : What if there were million doors, and Monty hall opened all the other 999,998 doors? You'd definitely change. It's the same.<br><br>



- Simpson's Paradox<br><br>
: : Is it possible to have two doctors where the first doctor has a higher success rate at every single possible type of surgery imaginable than the second one?
: : Yet the second doctor, overall, has a higher success rate.
: : Simpson's Paradox says it's possible.<br><br>
<img src="../../images/231112 stats 6-3.png" width="500px"><br><br>
: : Conditioning on each surgery, you'll choose Dr. Hibbert for both surgery
: : It's the same as 1/3 + 2/5 ≠ 3/8
: <br><b>Theoretical explanation</b><br><br>
: **A** : successful surgery
: **B** : treated by Dr. Nick
: **C** : we have heart surgery<br><br>
: P(A ⎸ B,C) < P(A ⎸ B<sup>C</sup>, C)
: P(A ⎸ B, C<sup>C</sup>) < P(A  ⎸ B<sup>C</sup>, C<sup>C</sup>)
: P(A ⎸ B) > P(A ⎸ B<sup>C</sup>)
<br><br>
: : C is a "confounder(교란 변수)" (What kind of surgery)<br><br>
: <br><b>Prove Simpson's Paradox wrong with law of total probability</b><br><br>
: : P(A ⎸ B) = P(A ⎸ B,C) · P(C ⎸ B) + P(A ⎸ B,C<sup>C</sup>) · P(C<sup>C</sup> ⎸ B) 에서
: : P(A ⎸ B,C) < P(A ⎸ B<sup>C</sup>,C),  P(A ⎸ B,C<sup>C</sup>) < P(A ⎸ B<sup>C</sup>,C<sup>C</sup>) 는 확인 가능하지만
: : P(C ⎸ B), P(C<sup>C</sup> ⎸ B)가 좌항, 우항에서 서로 다른 가중치로 작용하기 때문에 증명할 수 없다.<br><br>
: : Two flavors of jelly bean in each of 4 jars.
: : Suppose you like one flavor better than another
: : You just pick a random jelly bean from a jar.
: : Suppose jar A has higher percentage than jar B, jar C > jar D
: : And someone combined jars A, C in one jar, E, and B, D in one jar, F.
: : Now it could flip and jar F can have better chance to pick your favorite flavor
